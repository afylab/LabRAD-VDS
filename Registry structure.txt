Registry structure

ID (name)
	
	ID				ID of the channel.   Unique positive  integer.
	name			Name of the channel. Unique non-empty string.
					For accessing by ID/name:
						Unspecified ID   is interpreted from -1 (or any negative integer, but -1 is typically used)
						Unspecified name is interpreted from "" (an empty string)

	label			Default channel label for graph axes
	description		Description of the channel (string.)
	tags			List of tags, for organizing/searching channels
	hasGet			bool - whether or not the channel has get() functionality
	hasSet			bool - whether or not the channel has set() functionality

					Example of channel with get() but not set(): digital multimeter voltage readout (only for measuring)
					Example of channel with set() but not get(): voltage output of a device that doesn't have a get_voltage() command
					Example of channel with set() and     get(): voltage output of a device that does    have a get_voltage() command

	get
		setting			[server, device, setting] : points to the setting used for the get() command
		inputs 			List of input values for the get() command
		inputsUnits		List of corresponding units

	set
		setting			[server, device, setting] : points to the setting used for the set() command
		varSlot			which input position is the variable input (what the channel is being set to)
		varUnits		What units the variable input assumes. Always float? If so this property isn't needed
		statics 		List of static input values
		staticsUnits	List of corresponding units of the static values

		min			Minimum value of channel for set() function
		max			Maximum value of channel for set() function
		offset		Actual value set is centered around this value
		scale		Actual value set is scaled by this factor
					Actual = (Input * scale) + offset
